##Google Calendar

10. You can add documents, spreadsheets, and other files directly to an event so that your guests have all the information they need right in the event.
11. Support for multiple calendars for different aspects of life. Eg. one for work, one for family, one for play
12. Google Calendar automatically synchronises with google account which is heavily integrated into android.
