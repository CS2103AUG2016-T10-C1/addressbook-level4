##Google Calendar

###Pros

1. Quick add function
2. Similar to what we are trying to achieve, you can type the entire add command in one line with event description, time, location and it will interpret it for you and add as an event. It ties into Google Maps for event locations. So if it is recognised in Google Maps, you can choose an exact meeting place.
3. Support for recurring events
4. Google Calendar is remarkably social
5. Calendar can be shared.
6. Supports shared events.
7. Ability to find a common time for everyone to attend a shared event created by you based on their Google Calendars.
8. Can add a video call such that all attendees to a shared event can join the same video call
9. Ability to set a specific time zone for each event. For the frequent travellers.
10. You can add documents, spreadsheets, and other files directly to an event so that your guests have all the information they need right in the event.
11. Support for multiple calendars for different aspects of life. Eg. one for work, one for family, one for play
12. Google Calendar automatically synchronises with google account which is heavily integrated into android. 
13. Colour coding for events so that you can self-categorize according to colour.
14. Calendar view time frame can be switched. View by week, month.

###Cons

1. Lots of mouse clicks; lots of different columns to fill.
2. Security. Online so it can be hacked, revealing your life schedule.
