# Address Book (Level 4)

<img src="docs/diagrams/home.PNG" width="600"><br>

* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as 
  the main programming language. 
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is 
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
