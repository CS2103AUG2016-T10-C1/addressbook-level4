### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram_f.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/simply/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preference.
* Stores the Task Book data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.

> Note that `Model` does not depend on any of the other three components.

When you accidentally enter the wrong details for any of your tasks, worry not. The multiple edit task methods listed below allow you to update specific task details.

>Note: Adding a start time to a deadline will automatically convert a deadline to an event.

>Note: Adding a date to a to-do will automatically convert your to-do into a deadline with a default end time of 2359 on that date.

>Note: Removing the start time from a event will automatically convert your event to a deadline.

<br>
####2.1 Edit task description

Remember the birthday party previously entered? Perhaps now instead of entering Sam's birthday party, you want to change the description to Samantha's birthday party. To do so, simply follow the command format below.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **des** &lt;description&gt;

Example: edit E1 des Sam's birthday party

<br>
####2.2 Edit task date

Now, maybe the date of the birthday party you previously entered is also wrong and should be one day later instead. To change the date, use the following command. 

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **date** &lt;date&gt;

Example: Edit E1 date 21/12/16
<br><br>
>Note: If you add a date to a to-do, this will automatically convert your to-do into a deadline with a default end time of 2359 on that date.

<br>
If you wish, you can also remove the date of a task by following this format.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **date** no date; 

Doing so will change an event into a to-do. Removing the date from a deadline will also change it into a to-do.

<br>
####2.3 Edit task start time 

Samantha's birthday party is tomorrow and she has called to inform you that her party is starting two hours earlier at 5pm instead. To change the start time, simply use the following command.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **start** &lt;start time&gt;

Example: edit E1 start 5pm
<br><br>
>Note: Adding a start time to a to-do will automatically convert your to-do into an event with a default day of today, with a default end time of 2359 and start time as entered. 

<br>
If you wish, you can also remove the start time of a task by following this format.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **start** no start; 

Doing so will change a event into a deadline.

<br>
####2.4 Edit task end time 

Samantha has also informed you that the party is scheduled to end at 11pm, so that you can tell your parents when to pick you up. To update the end time, type the following and <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **end** &lt;end time&gt;

Example: edit E1 end 2300
<br><br>
>Note: Adding a end time to a to-do will automatically convert your to-do into a deadline with a default date of today and end time as entered. 

<br>
If you wish, you can also remove the end time of a task by following this format.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **end** no end; 

Doing so to an event will result in it's end time being set to a default of 2359. Removing the end time from a deadline will change the end time to a default of 2359. 

<br>
####2.5 Edit a specific tag

You have been very busy and forgot to buy Samantha's present so you want to remind yourself that you absolutely have to buy that present tomorrow for her. 

You can do so by changing the existing rememberToBuyPresent tag to AbsolutelyRememberToBuyPresent tag with the following command.

>Format: **edit** &lt;index&gt; **tag** &lt;old_tag&gt;`>`&lt;new_tag&gt;

Example: edit E1 #rememberToBuyPresent`>`#AbsolutelyRememberToBuyPresent

If there is only one tag, you can use the following command instead to change the tag.

>Format: **edit** &ltindex&gt new tag 

<br><br>
 
###3 Find Task by Keyword

Should you need to find any task based on details which you only partially remember, the find by keyword command can help you in finding them. Partial keywords are allowed and you can search for tasks by date, time or description. 

> Format: **find** &lt;keyword&gt;


Example: find report

Only tasks with the keyword are displayed. Keywords are NOT case sensitive.

If you no longer need any tasks, simply delete them by using the delete command availabe in the following formats. 

> Format: delete &lt;index&gt;

> Format: delete &lt;index&gt;-&lt;index&gt;
