## Appendix D : Glossary

##### Mainstream OS

> Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

##### Private task detail

> A task detail that is not meant to be shared with others


## Appendix E : Product Survey

##Google Calendar

###Pros

1. Quick add function
2. Similar to what we are trying to achieve, you can type the entire add command in one line with event description, time, location and it will interpret it for you and add as an event. It ties into Google Maps for event locations. So if it is recognised in Google Maps, you can choose an exact meeting place.
3. Support for recurring events
4. Google Calendar is remarkably social
5. Calendar can be shared.
6. Supports shared events.
7. Ability to find a common time for everyone to attend a shared event created by you based on their Google Calendars.
8. Can add a video call such that all attendees to a shared event can join the same video call
9. Ability to set a specific time zone for each event. For the frequent travellers.
10. You can add documents, spreadsheets, and other files directly to an event so that your guests have all the information they need right in the event.
11. Support for multiple calendars for different aspects of life. Eg. one for work, one for family, one for play
12. Google Calendar automatically synchronises with google account which is heavily integrated into android. 
13. Colour coding for events so that you can self-categorize according to colour.
14. Calendar view time frame can be switched. View by week, month.

###Cons

1. Lots of mouse clicks; lots of different columns to fill.
2. Security. Online so it can be hacked, revealing your life schedule.

##Todoist

###Pros

1. Colour code for priority, not time
2. Command allows for recurring days eg every day/every Tuesday/ holidays etc.
3. User able to choose subcatergories like task today, task tomorrow but (involves 1 click)
4. Task can divide to further catagories called projects like shopping , work personal, errands, or create your own(involves 1 click) >  for bigger projects subcategories can be created. Projects are shareable with others
6. Filters > priority setting priority1, priority 2, assign to me or assign to others
7. Adding priority (click 2 times) one for flag menu, two for flag colour 4 priority choices or add
8. Able to exploit templates for other projects
9. Lots of filters to choose from 
10. Add labels/ tags
11. Premium acc – add files to task. Supports third party integration eg link to dropbox/ integrates with other services like Zapier, Google Drive, Cloud Magic, Sunrise Calendar, and others
12. Uses drag and drop to shift tasks
13. Karma system> trend>> shows productivity over time > graph> bar(shows type for task done) / sets goals for the week / enable/ disable for vacations etc… a karma level eg grandmaster 5000+ to make user feel good
14. History : no limit
15. Bold italic control i control b

###Cons

1. not jim friendly, involves clicking form filling style eg. Click add> type task>click schedule>click to choose date or for recurring dates > type every day or every week. Edit>click and change
2. Able to link schedules with other people. Eg assign task to others(jim do not need it?)
3. Most of Jim’s todo items arrive as emails. 
4. Divides into too many catagories too messy for jim.
