### UI component

<img src="images/UIClassDiagram_f.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/simply/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`,
`DeadlineListPanel`, `TodoListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/simply/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

###7 Undo the Most Recent Commands

Oh no! What happens if you accidentally deleted something by mistake? In life, there are no undos but here, there are. The following undo command enables you to undo the most recent executed command, restoring anything lost.

> Format: undo &lt;number of operations&gt;

Example: undo 2
<br><br>
>Note: If no number is entered, the default number of times the command will undo is 1.
<br><br>
>Note: If you perform a add command to add a task after undoing another command, you will no longer be able to redo your undone command.

<br>
###8 Redo the Most Recent Undone Commands

If after using the undo command, you realise that the command you just undid is correct. Simply, type the following command to redo it.

> Format: redo &lt;number of operations&gt;

Example: redo 2
<br><br>
>Note: If no number is entered, the default number of times the command will redo is 1.

<br>

>Format: clear

<br>
###10 Exiting the program

When you are done and wish to exit the program, simply type exit and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This saves all your data and exits the program.

<br>
###11 Help

Should you forget how to use any of the commands, you can simply type help in the command box and <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

###12 Setting Storage Folder

If for any reason, you wish to change the location of the stored data file. Maybe so that you can synchronise that folder with online cloud storage services, you can change the folder by using the following command.

>Format: **storage** &lt;valid file path&gt;

Example: storage C:\Users\Ronald\Documents\DummyFolder

The task manager shifts your data file from the current storage folder to the newly specified one on exit.

<br>
## How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the default data file it generates with 
       your current data file.
       
>Note: Search for the default taskbook.xml file that is stored in the data folder and overwrite it.
