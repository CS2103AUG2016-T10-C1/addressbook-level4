###1 Add Command
There are three variations to the add command. You are able to choose a task to be categorized under events, deadlines or to-dos. To differentiate the formatting for these commands, refer to the section below.
<br><br>
####1.1 Add a to-do

To start things off, let us add a simple task with no date or time, just a simple task to be done anytime and anyday.

>Format: **add** &lt;to-do description&gt; &lt;#tag&gt;

Example: add go swimming #fitness
<br><br>
>Note: tags are optional and multiple tags can be added to all tasks.

<br>
####1.2 Add a deadline

Perhaps after adding a to-do, now you want to add a task with a deadline. Let's say you have to do a report by next Monday, 7pm.

>Format: **add** &lt;deadline description&gt;; &lt;date(DDMMYY)&gt;; &lt;end time&gt; &lt;#tag&gt;

Example: add complete report; 120916; 1900 #fml 
<br><br>
>Important: The date is compulsory when adding an deadline. If end time is not specified, a default of 11.59pm on the entered date is set.

<br>
####1.3 Add an event

Let's say you have to attend a friend's birthday party on the weekend. You know the date, the time it starts, as well as the time it ends.

>Format : **add** [&lt;event description&gt;; &lt;date(DDMMYY)&gt;; &lt;start time&gt;; &lt;end time&gt;] &lt;#tag&gt;

Example: add [Sam's birthday party; 20/12/16 ; 9pm] #birthday #rememberToBuyPresent

>Note: The start time and end time is optional when adding an event. If neither is specified, the default date will be the current date, the default start time will be the current time and the default end time will be 2359.

>Important: The square brackets are compulsory when adding an event.

<br>
####1.4 Add a tag / multiple tags to existing tasks

Your friend suddenly informs you that he has heard that your teacher has prepared a 'nice' surprise for students who submit the report due on Monday late. Now that the report due on Monday has become a very important task to do, simply type add followed by the index of the report and the tags to be added and <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

>Format: **add** &lt;index&gt; #tag1 #tag2

Example: Add D1 #VeryImportant #omg  

<br>
```
