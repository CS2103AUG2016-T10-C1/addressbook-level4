### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram_f.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/simply/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* Saves the Task Book data in xml format and reads it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.simply.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file.
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging.
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

You can find the Tests in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* You can see [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ which can be found in the `guitests` package that test the entire App by simulating user         actions on the GUI.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
   1. _Unit tests_ targets the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.simply.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ checks the integration of multiple code units 
     (these code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.simply.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests checks multiple code units as well as 
      how they are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.simply.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 This means that you can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

You can see [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
You can see [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

To make a new release, you can follow the steps below:
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file you have created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than alternatives such as:<br>
1. Including these libraries in the repo. (This bloats the repo size)<br>
2. Requiring developers to download these libraries manually. (This creates extra work for developers)<br>

###4 Marking tasks as done 

Remember the report that we added at the start? Once you have done it, simply type the following command below and <kbd>Enter</kbd> and you will never have to see it again. Unless of course, if you want to, then we will show you how in the later part of this user guide. 

> Format: done &lt;index&gt;

Example: done D1

This will hide the report that you have completed from the main screen.

<br>
You can also complete multiple tasks at once by following the formats below.

> Format: done &lt;index&gt;-&lt;index&gt;

Example : done T1-T3

This marks the range of tasks between the first index and the second index as done while this,

> Format: done &lt;index&gt;, &lt;index&gt;

Example: done T1, E2, D4

marks the specified indexes as done.

<br>
###5 Display tasks

####5.1 Display completed tasks

Remember how we have hidden away your completed report? If you wish to see it again, the following display command will display all completed tasks in their respective categories.

> Format: list done

From here, you can choose to delete these tasks. Deleting will be covered in the section after this. 

<br>
####5.2 Display all tasks

Now that you have seen all the tasks that you have done, to return to the main default screen, simply type the following command and <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

> Format: list
