**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/simply/logic/Logic.java)

* `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
* This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete E1")`
 API call.<br>
